Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goals of this app were to keep track of inventory for a small business using an intuitive and easy to use UI. The user needs that were addressed were the ability 
to store inventory items in a SQLLite database, as well asgive the user an option to enable SMS alerts when an item reaches zero quantity. The user shoud be able to add,
edit, or delete items from the database. The items should also be displayed on the screen using a grid. In addition the app needs to save user names and passwords to the
database.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
Why were your designs successful?

Screens that were neccessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI were a login screen, a screen to register, a screen that displays the items, 
a screen that allows the user to add an item, and a screen that asks the user for permission to send SMS alerts. Features that were neccessary were user account setup, 
a button to delete items that are displayed in the grid, a button that will bring up the screen to add an item, a button that will bring up the screen to edit an item, 
and a button that will bring up the screen to enable SMS alerts.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
For coding the app, I relied on information information i found in the resources available such as zyBooks to guide me. This information and resource, along with some others,
taught me how to create buttons, add images, add databases and how to make the layout user-friendly and intutitive. All of this can be applied to future projects creating
mobile apps.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
For testing, I used the de-bugger in Android Studio to ensure there no errors, as well as using the app myself and going through each screen and completing the various requirements.
This included, setting up an account, adding, editing, and deleting an item, and enabling SMS alerts and bringing an item's quantity down to zero to ensure it sent an alert.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One initial challenge i faced was getting Android Studio to run the app all together. I did research and found that in the gradle.build I had to adjust the SDK settings to match
what I had in my emulator. Another challenge was figuring out how to create and implement the SQLLite database, which i was able to resolve researching ZyBooks and developer.android.com.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe the screen that displays items in the inventory particularly shows where I have gained knowledge of developing apps in Android Studio as the screen is user-friedly 
and intuitive. It also allows the user to enable SMS alerts was a specific requirement of the projct.
